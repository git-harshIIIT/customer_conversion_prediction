# Customer Conversion Prediction using Machine Learning
<br>

## Introduction
Businesses in the competitive insurance sector are always looking for new and creative methods
to bring in new clients and keep existing ones while increasing conversion rates. Using machine
learning algorithms to forecast consumer behaviour and enhance marketing initiatives is one
such tactic. The purpose of this study is to investigate this area by developing a predictive model
for customer conversion in the insurance industry.

## Background
Insurance plans are essential for reducing financial risks for both
individuals and companies. Convincing customers to purchase insurance products is still very
difficult. Developing successful marketing strategies can be simplified by having an
understanding of the elements impacting consumer decisions. It has been believed that the
variables including age, marital status, occupation, and education level are important indicators
of consumer behaviour. <br> <br>
One of the fundamental steps towards better customer conversion is customer segmentation. This
is where personalization starts, and proper segmentation will help you make decisions regarding
targeting a specific age group, at a certain interval of month or calling a person for a certain
number of times only.

## Proposed Idea
The proposed solution to the customer conversion prediction problem represents a significant
improvement over the current methodology because it makes use of a range of machine learning
methods and provides in-depth evaluations of the effects of each feature in the dataset. Insurance firms and their staff should be able to make better decisions in terms of decision-making abilities, predictive accuracy, and model comprehension with the help of this suggested solution. <br> <br>
The use of several machine learning algorithms, such as KNN(K-Nearest Neighbours), Decision
Trees, XG Boost and Random Forests, is one of the main features of the suggested solution. A
more reliable and accurate prediction is made possible by choosing the best parameters for
training of other models like depth of Decision tree and Random Forest, learning rates of XG
Boost.
